# Algorand Summer School Hackathon

Here is our problem for the *Algorand Summer School Hackathon*. Instructions along with the deployment and testing script and the template smart contract with some additional help, were released on May 24th 2023 and submissions were accepted until May 31st 2023 at 23:59 (Buenos Aires time).\
Students were encouraged to solve the problem using TEAL in order to familiarize themselves with low level AVM programming, however it was possible to solve it using higher level frameworks (Beaker or PyTeal) with a couple workarounds.

The winners were announced on June 1st, 2023. \
Here is the podium:
- 1st place: *Andreas Mantzoutas*
- 2nd place: *Georgios Papadoulis, Chronis Sapountzakis, Konstantinos Mores*
- 3rd place: *Francisco Romano, Javier Godoy, Victor Daniel Cruz*
